# Requirements specification

## Sustainability Contributions

**Reuse:** Direct reuse of functional parts (control units, motors, panels, speakers, regulators) extends the lifespan of vehicles and reduces demand for new manufacturing, lowering overall environmental impact.

**Material Recycling:** Components that cannot be reused are often dismantled for raw materials-metals, plastics, and rubber-which are then processed and used in new products, including sustainable building materials and new automotive parts.

**Circular Economy:** The recycling and repurposing of automotive parts support a circular economy, conserving resources, reducing landfill waste, and minimizing the carbon footprint associated with producing new materials

## Requirements

The car door to be dissambled is [Audi A4 B8](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A4_B8).

The robot shall identify at least 5 distinct car door components using object detection algorithms with at least 80% accuracy.

The robot shall determine the specific tools required to handle each component.

The robot shall identify each tool required using object detection algorithms.

At least 3 actions to be performed by the robot:

- The robot shall be able to pull the cables.
- The robot shall be able to perform unscrewing action.
  - The robot shall be able to identify what type of screwdriver is required based on the screw (size, shape).
  - The robot shall be able to pick up the screwdriver, hold it securely, and perform the action.
  - The robot shall end the action when the screw has been unscrewed.
- The robot shall be able to perform panel removal.
  - The robot shall be able to disattach the panel.
  - The robot shall be able to hold the panel, and remove it.

Identify and define at least 3 key performance metrics to validate the robotâ€™s skills in car door disassembly.

- Speed

  - Robot can pull at different locations, trace the cable
  - Unplug the cable?
- Tweeter speaker
  - Requires cable to be removed first
  - Can be rotated and pulled from the panel

  - Afterwards the control unit can be pulled in one direction to remove
- Speaker
  - Requires tool: screwdriver
  - Requires cable to be removed first
  - 3 screws need to be removed first
  - Afterwards the speaker can be pulled from its mounting points as it's lightly glued to the door with adhesive insulation
- Window motor
  - Requires tool: screwdriver
  - Requires cable to be removed first
  - 3 screws need to be removed
  - Can be pulled from the door immediately afterwards

## Parts that would need to be removed by a human or would require human assistance

- Window
- Door frame
- Cables

## Parts which can be recycled
